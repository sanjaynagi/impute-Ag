This repo is for initial investigations into the use of imputation and phasing for low coverage sequecning data, in Anopheles gambiae, using Ag1000g and VObs data as haplotype reference panels, and the program GLIMPSE, which is from the authors of SHAPEIT and uses Richard Durbins PBWT to rapidly impute and phase SNP markers.

## Usage

If you use this workflow in a paper, don't forget to give credits to the authors by citing the URL of this (original) repository and, if available, its DOI (see above).

### Step 1: Obtain a copy of this workflow

1. Create a new github repository using this workflow [as a template](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-repository-from-a-template).
2. [Clone](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository) the newly created repository to your local system, into the place where you want to perform the data analysis.

### Step 2: Configure workflow

Configure the workflow according to your needs via editing the files in the `config/` folder. Adjust `config.yaml` to configure the workflow execution, and `samples.tsv` to specify your sample setup.

### Step 3: Execute workflow

Activate the conda environment:

    conda activate snakemake

Test your configuration by performing a dry-run via

    snakemake --use-conda -n

Execute the workflow locally via

    snakemake --use-conda --cores $N

using `$N` cores or run it in a cluster environment via

    snakemake --use-conda --cluster qsub --jobs 100

or

    snakemake --use-conda --drmaa --jobs 100

If you not only want to fix the software stack but also the underlying OS, use

    snakemake --use-conda --use-singularity

in combination with any of the modes above.
See the [Snakemake documentation](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/executable.html) for further details.
